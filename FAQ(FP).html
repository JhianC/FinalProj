        <h1>What is this website about?</h1>

    <p class="content">
        This website is all about sharing my personal collections of photos and poems that I've written within the span of senior highschool all throughout college, with some being written only
        recently due to this activity. My main goal for this website is to create a space in which I can store some of my precious memories in cases that they get deleted. This includes memorable
        photographs of places that I've visited as well as some of the poems that I've written during my free time.

            <h1>Why did I choose this as my website?</h1>
        </div>
    
        <p class="content">
            I really enjoy poetry and photography as I also tend to travel quite a lot especially during long vacations. Even during busy weeks, I still find time to roam around the streets of 
            Baguio City just to take in the view even though I've already seen a lot of it for the millionth time. It's a way for me to release the daily stressors that I face. It serves a therapeutic
            purpose that I can enjoy without spending any amount of money and have almost the same effect of doing therapy. All in all, I just really enjoy poetry and photography as for me, it coincides
            with each other and allows me to think freely and creatively on how I interpret the world around me.

            <h1>How does poetry and photography coincide with each other?</h1>
        </div>
        
        <p class="content">
            Personally, I believe that each photographs we take aren't only a part of our visual memory but also holds a deeper meaning than that. A photograph can be a representation of certain
            moments of time that we deem memorable regardless if it is positive or negative. Each photographs can also be symbolized through poetry as to give it a deeper meaning whilst also keeping
            the core meaning and details of what happened during that specific point of time. I use poetry that is accompanied by photos in order to relate our inner thoughts to what we see with our
            naked eyes alone. With this, it allows visual and mental creativity as anything can be interpreted depending on how you view it.
